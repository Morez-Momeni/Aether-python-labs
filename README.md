# Aether Python Labs

Aether Python Labs is a personal collection of Python projects, experiments, and exercises created as part of my learning journey in software development.  
This repository reflects my continuous progress as I explore Python fundamentals, algorithms, data structures, and modern programming practices.

# Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Strengthen my understanding of **Python programming concepts**.  
- Practice **clean code, modular design, and problem-solving**.  
- Build a portfolio that tracks my **growth as a developer** over time.

# Structure

Each folder represents a standalone project or concept area:
aether-python-labs:
- algorithms/ # Sorting, searching, recursion, etc.
- data_structures/ # Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees
- mini_projects/ # Small real-world Python apps
- automation/ # Scripts for automating tasks
- experiments/ # Random code experiments and tests
- README.md

# Technologies & Tools

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter / VS Code**
- **Git & GitHub for version control**
- **PEP8 style and clean code practices**

---

# Learning Focus

I’m currently focused on:
- Writing **efficient and readable code**
- Understanding **object-oriented design**
- Exploring **algorithms and problem-solving**
- Learning through **hands-on practice**
